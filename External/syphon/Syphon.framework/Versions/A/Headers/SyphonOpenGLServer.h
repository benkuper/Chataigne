Default sample count is 0 should this key be ommited, indicating no antialiased buffers will be used.

/*!
 A server handles the publishing of frames from one video source to any number of clients.
 
 Frames can be published either by passing in an existing OpenGL texture, or by binding the server's FBO, drawing using OpenGL calls, then calling the ``unbindAndPublish`` method.
 
 Each server represents one video output for your application. If your application produces several video outputs, then they should each have their own server. If your application might have multiple servers running, you should name each server to aid identification by users.
 
 It is safe to access instances of this class across threads, except for those calls related to OpenGL: a call to ``bindToDrawFrameOfSize:`` must have returned before a call is made to ``unbindAndPublish``, and these methods must be paired and called in order. You should not call the ``stop`` method while the FBO is bound.

 Creates a new server with the specified human-readable name (which need not be unique), CGLContext and options. The server will be started immediately. Init may fail and return `nil` if the server could not be started.
 
 This method does not lock the CGL context. If there is a chance other threads may use the context during calls to this method, bracket it with calls to `CGLLockContext()` and `CGLUnlockContext()`.

 @param serverName Non-unique human readable server name. This is not required and may be `nil`, but is usually used by clients in their UI to aid identification.

 Publishes the part of the texture described in region of the named texture to clients. The texture is copied and can be safely disposed of or modified once this method has returned.

 This method makes no changes to state in the caller's OpenGL context. In legacy OpenGL contexts other state changed is restored. In Core Profile OpenGL contexts work is conducted in a private shared context.
