             Given WinMD files, produce C++ code that implements COM IDispatch wrappers around the types in those WinMD files.

             There are several mechanisms to filter out types from the winmd that should not have code generated. They are
             applied in the following order of precedence:
            
             1. If the requireAllowForWebAttribute switch is set, then exclude all types without
                the AllowForWeb attribute.
            
             2. If the ignoreWebHostHiddenAttribute switch is set then exclude all types with
                the WebHostHidden attribute.
            
             3. Explicit include and exclude rules sorted by the length of the
                rule string. So more general rules are applied first followed by
                more and more specific rules. If rule text matches the type or
                namespace name, then the type is included or execluded based on
                the kind of rule.
            
             4. If the explicitIncludesOnly switch is set then include all types
                referenced by other included types. This applies recursively, so
                a type included due to this will also include all types
                it references.
            
             5. If there are no explicit include rules then a type that doesn't
                match any previous rule is included. Otherwise it is excluded.
