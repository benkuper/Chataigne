# Chataigne
Artist-friendly Modular Machine for Art and Technology
Official website : http://benjamin.kuperberg.fr/chataigne

### Intro

Chataigne is made with one goal in mind : create a common tool for artists, technicians and developers who wish to use technology and synchronize softwares for shows, interactive installations or prototyping.
It aims to be as simple as possible for basic interactions, but can be easily extended to create complex interactions.

### Okay, but what does it do exactly ?

While Chataigne won't do much by itself, its purpose is to be the central hub in a project involving multiple interfaces, softwares, devices and sensors.
You can see it as a Conductor, which will control all the softwares with the big picture in mind.
Chataigne as been designed to fit both linear shows and realtime/interactive project needs.

### Seems cool, tell me more !

You can check the tutorials to better understand what and how you can use Chataigne for your projects.

## Using the software

Compiled versions for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux are available at : http://benjamin.kuperberg.fr/chataigne/#download

If beta versions are available, they will show up on this page.

If you wish to test the latest features and commits, the bleeding-edge section is generated at each commit.

## Getting Started

You can start by checking the Amazing Chataigne Documentation, made with love ! https://benjamin.kuperberg.fr/chataigne/docs

Also you can watch tutorials from the website and follow the interactive guide from withing the application.

## Building the software

Chataigne is built on top of the JUCE frameworks. You can find more infos about it there : http://www.juce.com
Chataigne is using a modified version of JUCE. So you first need to compile the Projucer from the modified version of JUCE instead of downloading JUCE :

  - Clone the develop-local branch from the JUCE git here : http://github.com/benkuper/JUCE 
  ```
  git clone --branch=develop-local http://github.com/benkuper/JUCE
  ```
  - In the *JUCE/extras/Projucer/Builds* folder, choose the folder depending on you system, open the solution with your IDE and compile it or make in linux. You can then open the new Projucer app that you just built.
  
  - Clone Chataigne with --recursive options to integrate organicUI and timeline modules
  ```
  git clone --recursive http://github.com/benkuper/Chataigne
  ```
  - Launch the Projucer and open Chataigne.jucer
  - Set your Global Paths (see picture below) 
  - Save the jucer
  - Open the solution for you platform in the Builds folder
  - Build the solution from your IDE and compile it or make in linux
  - Check the dependency section below if you have dependency problems when running Chataigne
  - Enjoy !

### Linux specific tips
You'll need to build this lib to run the app:
https://github.com/HBPVIS/servus

You'll need at least these libs to compile the app:
```bash
apt-get install build-essential libbluetooth-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev  libfreetype-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libhidapi-dev
```

Compile it with the JUCE modules specified:
```bash
Chataigne/Builds/LinuxMakefile$ CXXFLAGS="-I../../../JUCE/modules -I" make -j8
```

To start the built binary:
```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/Servus/build/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./build/Chataigne
```

Alternatively put `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/Servus/build/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` into your .bashrc, and open a new terminal to make it work.



### Setting JUCE Global Paths
  
 ![Don't forget to set the paths  !](http://benjamin.kuperberg.fr/chataigne/user/images/juce_paths.png?) 
  
## Dependencies

### Windows running instructions ###
**DLL dependencies** :
  - For **Release**, you can just copy the dll files from there : http://benjamin.kuperberg.fr/chataigne/user/data/Chataigne-win-x64-release-dependencies.zip and paste them in the same folder as the generated executable (in the Binaries folder)
  
  - For **Debug**, you can get a dependency pack there http://benjamin.kuperberg.fr/chataigne/user/data/Chataigne-win-x64-debug-dependencies.zip and do the same in the Binaries/Debug folder
 
### Linux running instructions ###
  - Before running Chataigne, you just need to do a chmod a+x on the .AppImage file, or right-click on it and allow execution, then you're ready to play !  
  - If you're running Arch Linux, you can now just do `yay -S chataigne-stable-bin` or `paru -S chataigne-stable-bin` (Thanks Stephan !)
  - If you're running Raspberry Pi 4, you may need to install some more dependencies : `sudo apt install libbluetooth-dev libx11-dev`
## Troubleshooting

If you have any issue regarding the software, you can post an issue on github (preferred for code-related problems and features),
there is also the official forum here : http://benjamin.kuperberg.fr/chataigne/forum more suited for questions, wishes and user-level issues.
